3D Maze Game

A bit of an experiment to see if I could create a 3d maze type game engine in z80 assembler.

It is all fake 3d created with flat graphics.

Move around the maze with Left, Right and Up arrows.
Collect as many coins as you can before finding the exit.

No timers or energy running out, just find the way out.

No, there is not a monster!
